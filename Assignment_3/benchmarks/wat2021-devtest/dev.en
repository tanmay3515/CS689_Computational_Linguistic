These three heroes inspire us to this day.
It would be impossible to express in words the story of the supreme sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
That was the period when the desire for freedom, its intensity, and spread were on the rise.
This year marks the centenary of the Champaran Satyagraha.
In India’s struggle for freedom, Gandhian thought and Gandhian practice became manifest for the first time in Champaran.
We cannot evaluate the Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the image of Mahatma Gandhi that we cherish in our hearts today.
But if we reflect upon the Gandhi of a hundred years ago, the Gandhi of the Champaran Satyagraha, that would be a subject of deep study for anyone about to enter public life.
This desire of 125 crore countrymen for change, the effort to change, is what will lay a strong foundation of a ‘New India’.

The river flows under the Rispana Bridge before passing by my home.

“I bow to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj on his Jayanti.
India is proud that a valorous and great soul like him was born on our land.
Shivaji Maharaj placed wellbeing of his people above everything.
He was an ideal ruler blessed with exceptional administrative skills.
Just recently, I had the honour to join the programme for Shivaji Maharaj’s statue off the Arabian Sea.
He brings a message of friendship and peace, the President added.
Our key national symbols have taken inspiration from Buddhism.
Buddhism and its various strands are deep seated in our governance, culture and philosophy.
The divine fragrance of Buddhism spread from India to all corners of the globe.
Mahindra and Sanghamitra, the worthy children of King Ashoka made their journey from India to Sri Lanka as Dhamma-Doot to spread the biggest gift of Dhamma.
Today, Sri Lanka takes pride in being among the most important centres of Buddhist teachings and learning.
In some way, you took us back to our own roots.
The world also owes a debt of gratitude to Sri Lanka for preserving some of the most important elements of the Buddhist heritage.
Vesak is an occasion for us to celebrate this unbroken shared heritage of Buddhism.
My Tamil brothers and sisters will also be able to visit Varanasi, the land of Kashi Viswanath.
An opportunity to achieve a quantum jump in our partnership across different fields.
And, for us, the most relevant benchmark for the success of our friendship is your progress and success.
We are committed to the economic prosperity of our Sri Lankan brothers and sisters.
We will continue to invest in driving positive change and economic growth to deepen our development cooperation.
Our strength lies in sharing our knowledge, capacity and prosperity.
In trade and investment, we are already significant partners.
We believe that free flow of trade, investments, technology, and ideas across our borders will be to our mutual benefit.
India’s rapid growth can bring dividends for the entire region, especially in Sri Lanka.
In infrastructure and connectivity, transport and energy, we are poised to scale up our cooperation.
Our development partnership stretches across nearly every sector of human activity such as agriculture, education, health, resettlement, transport, power, culture, water, shelter, sports, and human resources.
And, its only aim is to support Sri Lanka in realizing a peaceful, prosperous and secure future for its people.
Because, the economic and social well being of the people of Sri Lanka is linked with that of 1.25 billion Indians.
Because, whether it is on land or in the waters of the Indian Ocean, the security of our societies is indivisible.
My conversations with President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickramasinghe have only reinforced our will to join hands in achieving our common goals.
As you make important choices for the harmony and progress of your society, you will find in India a friend and partner that will support your nation-building endeavours.
It has been a unifying force among nations.
The countries of South, Central, South East and East Asia are proud of their Buddhist links traced to the land of Buddha.
The themes of Social Justice and Sustainable World Peace, chosen for the Vesak day, resonate deeply with Buddha’s teachings.
The issue of Social justice is linked to conflict within and among communities.
Greed has driven the mankind to dominate and degrade our natural habitat.
I firmly believe that Buddhism’s message of peace is the answer to growing arc of violence all over the world.
And, not just a notion of peace defined by the absence of conflict.
But, an active peace where we all work to promote dialogue, harmony and justice, based on Karuna (compassion) and Pragya (wisdom).
Thank you once again for the honour to be with you.

Center will put in place a sound system in consultation with the states to ensure that the farmers can avail the full benefits from this decision.

Farmers used to face difficulties in accessing loans from banks for such additional activities.

There are about 7000 blocks in more than 700 districts of India.
It will make life easier for the people in these villages.

This budget provides for allocation of about Rs 1 lakh crore for the welfare of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes.
